# async-await-fs

1. It is not a complete collection, mostly a show case. For a complete set of methods see fs-extras
2. Remember you need to transpile the code, node is going to natively support async/await, in the meanwhile babel is a great option.
3. IT IS TESTED ON LINUX ONLY


>npm install async-await-fs
